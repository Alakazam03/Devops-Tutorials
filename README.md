# Open Source Tools 
1. A sample java spring boot application.
2. Jenkins for continuous integration
3. Docker for containerisation
4. ELK stack for big data analysis
5. Jmeter for visulizations.

# Jenkins
Suppose, you have a team of 10 people. Everybody is writing code and wants to test their changes. Someone needs to collect all the new packages and then compile it. But if an error arises its very difficult to figure out which piece of code caused that error.</br>

Jenkins is a continuous integration tools. Jenkins maintains a pipeline that will compile, build and test the code maintaining a context to the user. If found any failure, jenkins can alert the correspoding contributor.





# Docker
Docker is a continous delievery tool. 
In a business enterprise, requirements keeps changing and new updates keeps waiting for deployment.

Process of deployment has various pre-requistes steps that needs to be followed. Code that is contributed by the developer goes to the testing environment and then to staging environment before reaching to final production.

There are many issue can be faced throughout the stages.
* Testing environment should have same configuration as developer machine.
* There should not be any kernel dependency.
* Synchronizing environment across is a redundant task.


# Logstash
Logstash is an open-source, a server-side tool that is used to collect, parse and then process data centrally into a structured form. It provides various filters that enhances the insights and human readability.



# Elastic Search 
Elasticsearch is a distributed open source search engine released under Apache license. It is a REST API layer over Apacheâ€™s Lucene. It provides horizontal scalability, reliability and capability of a real-time search through the documents. Elasticsearch is able to search faster because it uses indexing to search over documents.


# Kibana 
Kibana is a tool to visualise indexed data in real time. It provides variety of visualisations to get the best meaning out of your data. Dashboards according to use case can be created  and gets updated with new data automatically.
